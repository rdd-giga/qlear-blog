QLEAR is excited to announce the upcoming launch of its V3 platform. This latest version comes with exciting new features and updated services that are more capable than ever before. V3 also introduces a brand new user interface that allows for a simple and straightforward display of tools and information at the user’s disposal. These changes will allow service providers to be much better equipped to meet the needs of their clients.

### A Stunning Display with Smart Features

QLEAR V3 has a completely new user interface that is very intuitive. Pages are now less cluttered, and only display information that is important and relevant to you. At the same time, we have made it easier for you to navigate the site by including a toolbar that links to many of the different features QLEAR offers. Finally, there is a new Global Search function, so you can always find what you need.

#### Navigation Toolbar and Workspace overview

To make it effortless to access the features available to you in V3, we have added a toolbar with tabs to many of these features. A new workspace overview tab keeps you up to date about data source and location status, location performance, and recent notifications and activity. The locations tab displays all of the project locations a workspace has. In addition to these, there are separate tabs to access data analysis tools like reports, graphs, and data tables. The last tab leads to the Kiosk tool, which has been significantly enhanced for V3.

#### Global Search

Another update for V3 is the addition of a global search bar at the top of the page. This tool facilitates the use of our platform because you can use it to search for workspaces, locations, and data sources. It can also be used to search for indicators and collections, which are new features to help with data organization.

### Customizable Tools for Analyzing and Visualizing Data

In QLEAR V3, we let you have much more control over how your data is analyzed and presented. We recognize the different needs and preferences of different clients, so there are new options that allow you to fulfill those requests. Users now have more control over reports, graphs, and data tables. Furthermore, as briefly mentioned earlier, the Kiosk has been modified to give clients more control over how they choose to present their data. 

#### Reports

Reporting capabilities have been expanded and enhanced. Whereas you could previously only receive weekly data analysis reports, you can now request reports for shorter periods of time, including daily reports. The format of reports can now also be customized to meet specific needs.

#### Graphs and Data Tables

Whereas in V2, you were restricted in how many sets of data you could compare at once, you now have the ability to compare as many data sets from one workspace as you want in the graphing function. Data tables are more flexible now, with new ways of downloading and filtering data. You now have the option of downloading average data for every hour or half hour. New options for filtering data include filtering by working hours and by different standards, including those from RESET, WELL, and LEED. Having more options means that you can now do more with your data.

#### Kiosk

The Kiosk visualization tool has been enhanced for V3. They now provide an easy way to display an overview of a project’s data and information to outside parties, such as company clients or building occupants. Projects can list live data for each of the parameters they are measuring, as well as emphasize certain data that may be more noteworthy and significant. Just like many of the previous tools mentioned, Kiosks can also be tailored to unique preferences by choosing different fonts, colors, and even images and videos to display. This gives project teams have a great deal of control over how they want to present their data for external purposes.

### More Ways to Keep Your Data Organized 

When different clients are counting on you to deliver thorough data reporting and analysis for their projects, keeping data neat and properly stored becomes a top priority. Therefore, QLEAR V3 allows you to organize data in new ways to keep information separate and easy to find. Indicators and collections provide new methods of organizing incoming data that were previously unavailable in V2. Furthermore, each project now has a Locations page so data coming from different projects is easily differentiable and accessible. 

#### Indicators

Indicators let you group data by category. These categories will typically represent different parameters that a project is measuring. A major benefit to grouping data by indicators is that this virtualizes the data from the hardware. This means indicators will retain historical data for a certain parameter even if the data source changes. As long as these data sources are grouped into the same indicator when they are in use, you won’t have to worry again about losing past data when you switch monitors.

#### Collections

Collections allow you to group together different indicators, such as different parameters that your project is currently measuring. However, many monitors can already collect data for multiple parameters, so what makes collections special is the fact that you can combine indicator data from different monitors into one collection. Previously unavailable in QLEAR V2, this creates endless possibilities for combining data to meet any and every client need.

#### Locations Page

As mentioned earlier, there is now a Locations tab that lists all of the projects belonging to a workspace. From there, you can visit every project’s Locations page, which is now a separate page that displays average data for the location, as well as data from each collection within the location. This helps keep a location’s data very organized, so you can know exactly where data is coming from and how a location is performing.

### A New and Improving Experience

With its newest version, QLEAR aims to be much better suited to handle your requests, and accommodate your needs. The changes made will ensure that the user experience is largely improved so that you can monitor and manage client data much more efficiently. However, our work doesn’t stop here. We have more enhancements on the way, and in the meantime, will be actively working with our clients to make sure that our platform is the best that it can be.
